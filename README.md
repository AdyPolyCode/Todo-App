# Todo-App



##############
- Flask Framework
- Flask Templates
- Flask Form
- SQLAlchemy database | SQlite db




##############
This is a web application made with flask.
The application is fully working except that the css style for some reason wont load normally, in every
  web browser it is a must to force reload the page so you can see the styling as well.




##############
CSS / HTML structure is very basic
  background were added
  font-sizing / color / style
  marging / padding / spacing



  etc.
Basically not an advanced style. But for the needs it is enough in my opinion.




##############
Functionality :
  It has 3 main functionalities :
    - Add a new todo into the working database
    - Remove a recently added todo from the database
    - Update a recently added todo in the database
